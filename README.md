# Huffman-coding
This implementation of Huffman code that is a particular type of optimal prefix code which is commonly used for lossless data compression

A Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding

The steps i followed:
      a)Encoding:The steps I followed were Making Frequency Dictionary,Constructing Heap, Constructing Binary Tree,Building Codes ,Encoding Text,Padding Encoding Text Convert,                                     Into Bytes,Compressing File.
      
      b)Decoding: Decompressing Text ,Remove Padding, Decoding Text.
